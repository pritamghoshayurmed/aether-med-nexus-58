# Bug Fixes Implementation Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Row-Level Security Policy Violation
**Problem:** When signing up, users received "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'profiles'" error.

**Solution:** Added missing INSERT policies for all role-related tables in `supabase-rls-fix.sql`.

### 2. ✅ Automatic Dashboard Redirect After Signup
**Problem:** After successful signup, users were redirected to login page instead of their role-specific dashboard.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to return the user's role after successful signup
- Updated `Signup.tsx` to automatically redirect to appropriate dashboard based on role
- Added profile fetching and localStorage role storage after signup

### 3. ✅ Dummy Data Showing in Dashboards
**Problem:** Dashboards displayed hardcoded dummy data instead of actual user information.

**Solution:**
- Updated `DoctorDashboard.tsx` to use `useAuth()` hook for actual user data
- Updated `PatientSettings.tsx` to fetch and display real user data from database
- Already implemented in `PatientDashboard.tsx` and `Profile.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Settings Section Not Showing Actual User Details
**Problem:** Settings page showed dummy data and couldn't update actual user information.

**Solution:**
- Completely refactored `PatientSettings.tsx` to use `useAuth()` and `usePatient()` hooks
- Integrated real-time data fetching and updating
- Added proper form state management with actual database values

## Database Schema Updates Required

### **IMPORTANT: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor**

Execute the SQL commands in `supabase-rls-fix.sql` file. This will:

1. Add INSERT policies for profiles table (fixes signup error)
2. Create missing tables:
   - `hospitals` - For hospital/clinic accounts
   - `super_admins` - For admin accounts
   - `doctor_verification_requests` - For doctor license verification
   - `hospital_verification_requests` - For hospital registration verification
   - `user_sessions` - For "Remember Me" functionality
3. Add proper Row-Level Security policies for all tables
4. Create necessary indexes for performance

### Steps to Apply Database Changes:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase-rls-fix.sql`
4. Copy all the contents
5. Paste into a new query in Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Signup Flow:
1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Select a role (Patient, Doctor, Hospital, or Admin)
4. Click "Create account"
5. **Expected:** User should be redirected directly to their role-specific dashboard
6. **Expected:** No RLS policy violation errors

### Test Dashboard Display:
1. Log in or sign up as a user
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. **Expected:** Your actual name should be displayed, not dummy data
4. **Expected:** "Good morning, [Your Name]" instead of "Good morning, Patient"

### Test Settings Page:
1. Navigate to Settings (Patient Dashboard → Settings)
2. **Expected:** See your actual email, name, and other data
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Modify some fields
5. Click "Save"
6. **Expected:** Changes should be saved to database
7. Refresh the page
8. **Expected:** Changes should persist

### Test Profile Page:
1. Navigate to Profile (Patient Dashboard → Profile)
2. **Expected:** All your actual data should be displayed
3. Profile completion percentage should reflect actual data
4. Edit and save should work properly

## Dashboard Routes by Role

- **Patient:** `/dashboard/patient`
- **Doctor:** `/dashboard/doctor`
- **Hospital:** `/dashboard/hospital`
- **Admin:** `/dashboard/super-admin`

## Additional Improvements Made

### Data Management:
- All patient data properly fetched from `patients` table
- Profile data fetched from `profiles` table
- Proper separation of concerns between user auth and role-specific data

### User Experience:
- Seamless signup to dashboard flow
- Real-time data display
- Proper form validation and error handling
- Success/error toast notifications

### Security:
- Proper RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Role-based access control maintained
- Secure data updates with proper authentication checks

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

### For Doctor Dashboard:
1. Create settings page similar to patient settings
2. Fetch doctor-specific data (specialty, license_number, etc.)
3. Display actual appointment data
4. Show real patient list

### For Hospital Dashboard:
1. Create settings page for hospital information
2. Fetch hospital-specific data
3. Display actual bed availability
4. Show real doctor list

### For All Dashboards:
1. Implement real appointment fetching and display
2. Connect actual notification system
3. Implement proper data refresh on navigation
4. Add loading states for better UX

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Verify all SQL migrations ran successfully
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
5. Clear browser cache and localStorage if needed

## Summary

All critical bugs have been fixed:
- ✅ No more RLS policy violations during signup
- ✅ Automatic redirect to dashboard after signup
- ✅ Real user data displayed instead of dummy data
- ✅ Settings page fully functional with real data
- ✅ Proper data persistence and updates

The application is now ready for testing and further development!
