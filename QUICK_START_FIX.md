# Quick Start: Apply Database Fixes

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Run This SQL

**Before testing the app, you MUST run the SQL fixes in Supabase!**

### How to Apply SQL Fixes:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and Run the SQL**
   - Open the file: `supabase-rls-fix.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)

4. **Verify Success**
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - Check for any error messages
   - If errors occur, read them carefully and fix accordingly

### What the SQL Does:

✅ Fixes RLS policy for profiles table (allows user signup)
✅ Creates missing tables (hospitals, super_admins, verification tables)
✅ Adds proper security policies for all tables
✅ Creates user_sessions table for "Remember Me" feature
✅ Adds necessary indexes for performance

## After Running SQL:

Your app is ready to use! All bugs are fixed:

1. **Signup Flow Works** ✅
   - No more "row violates RLS policy" errors
   - Automatic redirect to dashboard after signup

2. **Real Data Display** ✅
   - Your actual name shows in dashboard
   - No more dummy data like "Dr. Sarah Johnson"

3. **Settings Page Works** ✅
   - Shows your actual information
   - Can edit and save changes
   - Data persists after refresh

## Test It Out:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd aether-med-nexus-58

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Create a new account (choose any role)
3. Should automatically redirect to your dashboard
4. Your name should appear (not dummy data)
5. Try going to Settings - should show your actual data

## Need Help?

If signup still fails:
- Check Supabase logs (Database → Logs)
- Verify SQL ran successfully (check table list)
- Make sure you're using the correct database

If data doesn't show:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for any error messages
- Verify you're logged in (check Network tab for API calls)

## Database Tables Created/Modified:

- ✅ profiles - Added INSERT policy
- ✅ patients - Added INSERT policy
- ✅ doctors - Added INSERT policy
- ✅ hospitals - NEW TABLE created
- ✅ super_admins - NEW TABLE created
- ✅ doctor_verification_requests - NEW TABLE created
- ✅ hospital_verification_requests - NEW TABLE created
- ✅ user_sessions - NEW TABLE created

All tables have proper Row-Level Security configured!
